# To-dos

* Improve the UI with the chart (topics by scores)
* Develop other methods than the focused closeness centrality (focused betweenness centrality, focused information centrality and focused random walk betweenness centrality)
* Add some ruby doc
* Separate the brain part from the webapp part in order to make it a gem
